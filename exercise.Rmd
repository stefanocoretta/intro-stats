**Independent variables**: the variables that are manipulated, the effect of which we are interested in.

**Dependent variable**: the variable affected by the independent variables.

These are also called (more transparently) **predictors** and **outcome** respectively.

```{r data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height="600px", fig.align='center'}
elp <- read_csv("data/ELP_frequency.csv")

elp %>%
  ggplot(aes(log(Freq), RT, label = Word)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, colour = "yellow") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "white") +
  geom_label_repel(size = 20 /.pt) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 26))
```

**Predictor**: Logged lexical frequency.

**Outcome**: Reaction Time.

What happens to reaction times (*outcome*) when we change the logged lexical frequency (*predictor*)?

.center[.f1[.green[*outcome*] ~ .purple[*predictor*]]]

The tilde `~` means 'as a function of'.

.green[Reaction time] *as a function of* .purple[log frequency].

# Formal notation

<br>

.center[.f1[.green[RT] ~ .purple[log(Freq) + W_length + ...]]]

There can be many predictors.

???

In fact there can also be more than one outcome variable, but you can ignore that.

Models with more than one outcome variable are called *multivariate* models.

NOTE: Linear regressions with one predictor are called *simple* linear regressions, while those with more than one predictor are called *multiple* or *multivariable* linear regressions. You don't have to remember this in order to be able to use linear models. They all work the same.

We won't go into the technical details, but the type of specific linear model depends on the type of outcome variable.

EXTRA: If you *are* curious about the technicalities, you can have a read here: https://stefanocoretta.github.io/post/2021-08-21-regression-models-a-cheat-sheet/ You need to have a basic understanding of probability distributions in order to get the most out of the post.
