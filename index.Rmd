What is knowledge?

What does "knowledge" mean to you?

Where does knowledge come from?

*Empirical* just means 'based on observation'.

Check out the etymology of the word *empiric(al)* here: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/empiric#English>

Do not mix up empirical methods with experimental methods. Experiments are a kind of empirical method.

How does the process look like?

# Empirical method 

.center[
![:scale 40%](img/bro.png)
]

???

We have a question about something.

Let's imagine that this something is the population of British Sign Language signers.

We want to know whether the cultural background of the BSL signers is linked to different pragmatic uses of the sign for BROTHER.

But we can't survey the entire population of BSL signers.

NOTE: *Population* can be a set of anything, not just a specific group of people. For example, the words in a dictionary can be a "population"; or the antipassive constructions of Austronesian languages; or ...

# Empirical method 

.center[
![:scale 75%](img/inference.png)
]

???

We take a **sample** from the population.

This is our empirical data (the product of observation).

How do we go from data/observation to answering our question?

We can use **inference**.

**Inference** is the process of understanding something about a population based on the sample (aka the data) taken from that population.

From sample/data to population.

# Inference is not infallible

???

Inference based on data does not guarantee the answer to our questions are right/true.

In fact, any observation we make comes with a degree of **uncertainty and variability**.

# Uncertainty and variability

Dealing with uncertainty in the observation.

Dealing with variability among observations of the same phenomenon.

# WHAT IS STATISTICS?

# What is statistics?

- Statistics is the **science** concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. (From [UCI Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu/what-is-statistics/))

--

- Statistics is the **technology** of extracting information, illumination and understanding from data, often in the face of uncertainty. (From the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/blog/what-is-statistics/))

--

- Statistics is a **mathematical and conceptual** discipline that focuses on the relation between data and hypotheses. (From the [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/))

--

- Statistics as the **art** of applying the science of scientific methods. (From [ORI Results](https://www.oriresults.com/articles/blog-posts/the-art-of-statistics/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00898-0))

# What is statistics?

> **Statistic is both a science and an art**.
>
> It is a **science** in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application and an **art** in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.

—L. H. C. Tippett

# How do you do statistics?

- You deal with uncertainty.

- You deal with variation.

In other words, how do you do data analysis?

---

Data visualisation and modelling

---

# Data viz

---

# Modelling (and testing)

All models are wrong, some are less wrong than others.

Uncertainty and variation => ESTIMATION.

---

# One model to fit them all

Linear regression models

or simply Linear models

---

[data from Bodo's book]

# Fit a line

```{r}

```

---

# Give me a line and I will model the world

Linear models can be used for virtually any type of data.

Once you learn how to run a linear model, you can use it with anything.
